# Wireless Penetration Testing

**Objectives**

- Learn techniques for auditing wireless networks
- Use tools like airodump-ng and aircrack-ng

**Exercises**

1. Capture handshake packets using `airodump-ng`.
2. Crack a WPA2 PSK using `aircrack-ng` with captured handshake.

**Code Snippet**

```bash
# Start monitor mode
airmon-ng start wlan0

# Capture handshake
airodump-ng --bssid <AP_BSSID> -w capture wlan0mon
```

**Challenges**

- Conduct a targeted deauthentication attack.
- Implement measures to protect against rogue access points.
