# Overview

Web application security focuses on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in websites and services. This module covers common injection flaws, scripting attacks, request forgery, and API security, empowering you to build and test secure web applications.

### Why Web Security is Critical

Web applications often expose sensitive data and business logic to users. A single flaw can lead to data breaches, session hijacking, or full system compromise. Understanding web security is essential for developers, testers, and security professionals.

## Topics

### OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document listing the ten most critical web application security risks. You'll study each category—like A1: Injection and A7: Identification and Authentication Failures—and learn practical mitigation strategies.

### SQL Injection Prevention Techniques

SQL injection occurs when untrusted input alters SQL queries. We'll explore parameterized queries, ORM best practices, input validation, and whitelisting to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation

XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages. You will learn output encoding, Content Security Policy (CSP), and input sanitization techniques to defend against Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS.

### CSRF Protection Strategies

Cross-Site Request Forgery forces authenticated users to perform unwanted actions. We'll cover anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and clever API design patterns that prevent CSRF attacks on forms and AJAX endpoints.

### Securing RESTful APIs

APIs introduce new security challenges, like broken object-level authorization. You'll learn authentication (OAuth, JWT), rate limiting, input validation, and proper error handling to secure modern web services.

## Self-Assessment

1. Describe two injection prevention techniques besides parameterized queries.
2. Explain how CSP can help in mitigating XSS attacks.
3. What is the purpose of CSRF tokens and how are they validated?
4. List three best practices for securing a RESTful API.
