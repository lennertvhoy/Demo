# Overview

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks often aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information; extort money; or disrupt normal business processes. A strong grasp of cybersecurity fundamentals helps organizations and individuals maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of their data.

### Why Cybersecurity Matters

In today's interconnected world, cyber threats can come from nation-states, criminal organizations, or lone actors. Whether it's a data breach exposing millions of user records or a ransomware attack halting critical infrastructure, the consequences can be severe. By understanding core principles and best practices, you can anticipate threats and defend effectively.

## Topics

### Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity encompasses the technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect information assets. You'll learn about the threat landscape—including malware, phishing, insider threats—and how risk management frameworks help prioritize defenses.

### CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

The CIA Triad is a model for guiding security policy:
- **Confidentiality** ensures information is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Integrity** ensures data is accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability** ensures timely and reliable access to information.

Maintaining balance among these three pillars is crucial for robust security.

### Common Threats and Vulnerabilities

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities such as weak passwords, unpatched software, and misconfigured systems. We'll explore how threat actors leverage these gaps and how vulnerability scanning and patch management reduce risk.

### Risk Management Process

Risk management involves identifying assets, assessing threats and vulnerabilities, calculating risk levels (likelihood × impact), and implementing controls. Frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001 provide structured approaches to governance.

### Security Policies and Procedures

Effective security programs rely on documented policies (acceptable use, access control) and procedures (incident response, change management). These guide employees and standardize responses to security events.

## Self-Assessment

1. What are the three principles of the CIA triad and why are they important?
2. Name two common vulnerabilities and describe how attackers exploit them.
3. Outline the steps of a basic risk management process.
