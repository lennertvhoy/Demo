# Overview

Ethical hacking simulates attacker tactics to identify security weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them. This module covers the full penetration testing lifecycle, from planning and reconnaissance to exploitation and reporting.

### Why Ethical Hacking Matters

Organizations must proactively discover vulnerabilities in their own environments. Ethical hacking provides a controlled, systematic approach to uncovering security gaps, ensuring that defenses are tested and improved regularly.

## Topics

### Penetration Testing Phases

The penetration testing lifecycle includes:
1. **Planning & Scoping**: Define goals, rules of engagement, and legal considerations.
2. **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about target systems using passive and active techniques.
3. **Scanning & Enumeration**: Identify live hosts, open ports, and services.
4. **Exploitation**: Leverage vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Expand access, maintain persistence, and collect evidence.
6. **Reporting**: Document findings, risk levels, and remediation steps.

### Reconnaissance and Footprinting

Reconnaissance gathers publicly available information: DNS records, social media footprints, and network infrastructure. Tools like WHOIS, dig, and Google dorking help map attack surfaces before deeper scanning.

### Vulnerability Scanning and Exploitation

Automated scanners (like Nessus) detect known vulnerabilities, while manual exploitation tools (Metasploit) validate findings. You will learn to interpret scan reports, prioritize issues, and safely execute exploits in labs.

### Post-Exploitation Techniques

Once inside a system, attackers escalate privileges, move laterally, and maintain persistence. We'll cover privilege escalation, pivoting through internal networks, and data exfiltration methods.

### Reporting and Remediation

A clear, concise report communicates vulnerabilities, severity, and recommended fixes. You will practice writing executive summaries, technical details, and risk mitigation plans that stakeholders can act on.

## Self-Assessment

1. List and describe the six phases of a penetration test.
2. What are the key differences between passive and active reconnaissance?
3. Explain why post-exploitation is critical even after initial access is achieved.
4. What components make a penetration testing report effective?
