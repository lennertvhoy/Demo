# Overview

Network security involves protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of networks and data as they are transmitted across or accessed through network systems. In this module, you will learn how to design, implement, and manage security controls to defend against threats targeting network infrastructure.

### Why Network Security Matters

Networks are the backbone of modern organizations. A single misconfiguration or vulnerable device can expose the entire network to attacks like eavesdropping, unauthorized access, or denial of service. By securing your network, you reduce the attack surface and prevent expensive breaches.

## Topics

### TCP/IP Security

The TCP/IP protocol suite underlies most internet communications. However, protocols like ARP, DNS, and IP lack built-in security, making them susceptible to spoofing, poisoning, or amplification attacks. Understanding these vulnerabilities helps you deploy mitigations such as ARP inspection, DNSSEC, and rate limiting.

### Firewalls

Firewalls enforce network segmentation by filtering traffic based on predefined rules. You will learn to configure packet-filtering, stateful, and next-generation firewalls, define access control lists (ACLs), and implement network address translation (NAT) for additional security.

### VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

VPNs create encrypted tunnels over public networks to ensure secure remote access. We'll cover IPsec and SSL/TLS VPN technologies, key exchange mechanisms, and best practices for certificate management to protect data in transit.

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

IDS detect anomalies or known attack signatures, while IPS take real-time preventive actions. You'll explore signature-based and anomaly-based detection, deployment modes (inline vs passive), and tuning techniques to minimize false positives.

### Network Monitoring and Logging

Effective security relies on visibility. You'll use tools like Wireshark, SNMP, and syslog servers to collect and analyze network traffic and logs. We'll discuss log retention policies, alerting thresholds, and integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.

## Self-Assessment

1. Explain three common TCP/IP protocol vulnerabilities and their mitigations.
2. Compare stateful vs. stateless firewalls and give an example use case for each.
3. Describe how a VPN secures remote communications and list two VPN protocols.
4. What is the difference between IDS and IPS, and when would you use each?
5. Name two network monitoring tools and describe what type of data they collect.
