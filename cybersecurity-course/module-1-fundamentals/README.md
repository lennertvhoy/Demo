## ðŸ“– Content

### 1. Introduction to Cybersecurity

**What is Cybersecurity?**
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. It encompasses:
- Information security
- Network security
- Application security
- Operational security
- Disaster recovery
- End-user education

**Why is Cybersecurity Important?**
- **Data Protection**: Safeguarding sensitive personal and business information
- **Financial Security**: Preventing financial losses from cyber attacks
- **Reputation Management**: Maintaining trust and credibility
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting legal and industry requirements
- **National Security**: Protecting critical infrastructure

### 2. The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundational model for information security:

#### **Confidentiality**
- Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- Implementation methods:
  - Encryption
  - Access controls
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Data classification

#### **Integrity**
- Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
- Preventing unauthorized modification
- Implementation methods:
  - Hashing algorithms
  - Digital signatures
  - Version control
  - Change monitoring

#### **Availability**
- Ensuring authorized users have reliable access to information
- Implementation methods:
  - Redundancy
  - Backup systems
  - Disaster recovery plans
  - DDoS protection

### 3. Types of Cyber Threats

#### **Malware**
- **Viruses**: Self-replicating programs that attach to files
- **Worms**: Standalone malware that spreads automatically
- **Trojans**: Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment
- **Spyware**: Secretly collects user information
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted advertisements

#### **Social Engineering**
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing attacks
- **Pretexting**: Creating false scenarios to obtain information
- **Baiting**: Offering something enticing to spark curiosity
- **Quid Pro Quo**: Offering a service in exchange for information

#### **Network Attacks**
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: Overwhelming systems with traffic
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting communications
- **DNS Spoofing**: Redirecting traffic to malicious sites
- **Session Hijacking**: Taking over user sessions

#### **Application Attacks**
- **SQL Injection**: Inserting malicious SQL code
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts
- **Buffer Overflow**: Overwriting memory boundaries
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Attacking unknown vulnerabilities

### 4. Threat Actors

Understanding who might attack and why:

#### **Script Kiddies**
- Low skill level
- Use existing tools
- Motivated by curiosity or notoriety

#### **Hacktivists**
- Politically or socially motivated
- Target organizations opposing their beliefs
- Examples: Anonymous, LulzSec

#### **Cybercriminals**
- Financially motivated
- Organized crime groups
- Ransomware operators

#### **Nation-State Actors**
- Government-sponsored
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Espionage and sabotage

#### **Insider Threats**
- Employees or contractors
- Intentional or unintentional
- Often the most dangerous

### 5. Security Frameworks and Standards

#### **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
Five core functions:
1. **Identify**: Asset management and risk assessment
2. **Protect**: Access control and protective technology
3. **Detect**: Continuous monitoring and detection processes
4. **Respond**: Response planning and communications
5. **Recover**: Recovery planning and improvements

#### **ISO 27001/27002**
- International standard for information security management
- Provides best practices for information security controls
- Certification available for organizations

#### **CIS Controls**
- Prioritized set of actions to protect against cyber attacks
- 18 controls organized by implementation groups
- Practical and actionable security measures

#### **OWASP**
- Open Web Application Security Project
- Focuses on web application security
- Maintains the OWASP Top 10 list of vulnerabilities

### 6. Defense in Depth

A layered security approach:

1. **Physical Security**: Locks, guards, surveillance
2. **Perimeter Security**: Firewalls, DMZ
3. **Network Security**: IDS/IPS, segmentation
4. **Host Security**: Antivirus, host firewalls
5. **Application Security**: Secure coding, testing
6. **Data Security**: Encryption, access controls
7. **User Security**: Training, awareness

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

1. Cybersecurity is a multi-faceted discipline requiring technical and human elements
2. The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) guides security decisions
3. Threats come in many forms and from various actors with different motivations
4. No single security measure is sufficient; defense in depth is essential
5. Frameworks provide structured approaches to implementing security
